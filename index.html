            <h5>Decentralized</h5>
            <p>
              There is less likely to be a single point of failure, because there is no central server involved in this network. Your work
              won’t be disturbed by the downtime of any kind of server. That also means that there will be less censorship
              and you will have more control over your content.
              <h5>Rewards</h5>
              <p>
                We think that those who deliver, should be rewarded for their time, knowledge or entertainment without having to solicit
                for donations for their work.
